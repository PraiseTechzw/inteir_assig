📖 How It Works
Home Screen
Fetches product data from an API and displays it using a list.
Managed using HomeBloc, which separates events, states, and logic.
Form Validation
Utilizes Formz for custom validation logic for fields like email and password.
Displays validation errors and allows submission only when the form is valid.
Audio Playback
Plays audio files using Just Audio.
Includes basic controls for play, pause, and stop.
